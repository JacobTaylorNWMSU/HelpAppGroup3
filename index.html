                        <h2>About Us</h2>
                        <p>The local Health Emergency Lifeline Program, Inc. (H.E.L.P.) is a Lifeline Program Partner with Philips Lifeline. 
                            HELP buys and then leases equipment to subscribers within Nodaway County to use to signal when a medical emergency occurs.  
                            Knowing that emergency assistance is available with the push of a button allows subscribers to remain in their own home 
                            and maintain an independent lifestyle. </p>
                        <br />
                        <h2>Our Shared Purpose</h2>
                        <p>Health Emergency Lifeline Program, Inc. (HELP) is an all-volunteer organization providing LifelineTM technology to community 
                            members living in Nodaway County and designated adjacent communities. </p>
                        <br />
                        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                        <p>As volunteers we strive to provide dependable and reliable services linking subscribers to an emergency response center in case 
                            of a health emergency through appropriate technology at reasonable cost thereby allowing the subscriber to remain independently 
                            in the comfort and safety of their personal residence.</p>
                        <br />
                        <h2>Caring Community Volunteers Provide Program Services</h2>
                        <p>As an all-volunteer organization, Lifeline services are provided by Nodaway County community members who find fulfillment in serving their neighbors in need.</p>
                        <br />
                        <h2>Emergency Response at the Touch of a Button</h2>
                        <div>
                            <p><img src = "img/7000 Communicator and Standard Button.jpg" width = "25%" height = "200px" style = "margin-left: 15px; float: right">
                            With the touch of a button, a Lifeline subscriber is connected to central monitoring staff that assess the emergency and 
                            quickly send the appropriate assistance, 24 hours a day,7 days a week, even on holidays.  Lifeline subscribers remain at home, 
                            leading more comfortable and fulfilling lives.</p>
                            <p>The AutoAlert help button worn on the outside of the subscriberâ€™s clothing, detects a fall by the velocity of the swing of this button during the fall.
                                Central Monitoring, following a fall, monitors for approximately 30 seconds.  If the subscriber is not able to get up, Central Monitoring sends a call 
                                for help.  Subscribers with the AutoAlert may select to have EMTs dispatched immediately or to have a family member or other personal responder come first.</p>
                            <p>Lifeline subscribers select normally three individuals to serve as responders in case of an emergency.  That caring support comes from neighbors, family members 
                                or friends chosen by the subscriber.</p>
