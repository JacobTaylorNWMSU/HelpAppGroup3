# Changing an Image
### To change an image first add the file to the img folder. Then find the line in the index.html file and change the part of the code where it says 
`src = "img/image.jpg" `
### and change the image.jpg part to the image file you want.

# Adding a New Image
### To add a new image you would have to add the image file into the folder "img". From there you can find a place in the index.html file and add the following, with the changes for the file, 
`<img src = "img/image file.jpg" alt="display image">` 

# Updating CDN Syle Links

### To update the CDN style links you would need to change the "href" part of the link to the link containing the style sheets you want to use. After that you would look for the corresponding "script" line of code and change that link to the desired link and path.
